For testing purposes, there are multiple prepared methods.

pytest -v

coverage run [python script]

coverage report -m

This will report the coverage and the lines of code which are unused.

coverage html

This will produce an interactive html to show the actual lines of code.


using this on the test it shows the test coverage.

This can be more accurately with pytest:

pytest -v --cov=[python script] --cov-report=html
